Hello :)

My day contains 14h15 because I need 9h sleeping time and I count 30 minutes to fall asleep as well as 15 minutes to wake up.

If I wake up at 08h00, I should therefore be in bed by 22h15.

In order to regulate my sleeping schedule, starting the day with a proactive, important, and pleasurable activity is an effective strategy - making breakfast while being hungry, practicing touch typing on a mechanical keyboard, say hi to a friend are interesting options.

A shower at night allows keeping a somewhat clean bed and a pleasurable sleep, as long as I take care of body temperature elevation/decrease timing properly.

The best time perimeter for exercising is before shower. An excellent energizer lies in washing the dishes.

At the end of the day, it is important to do a retrospective in order to have a quality moment with oneself (as opposed to always being driven by circumstances, activities, needs or desires) in a positive moment, as well as to prepare the next day.

At the start of the day, refreshing that plan that was already prepared, enables a motivation boost by giving a direction to the day.

A key metric to assess to state of the sleep schedule management, is whether or not, on Sunday evening, I am able to start the week correctly.

So....

GOOD
